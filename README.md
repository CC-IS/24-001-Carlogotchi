# 24-001-Carlogotchi

This project makes use of an ESP32-S2 Mini and a small TFT touchscreen to render a simplified version of a tamogotchi. 

To render images to the touchscreen, this project makes use of the [TFT_eSPI library](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI). Installation instructions will be coming soon!
